Firefox and KWallet5 password integration

Firefox stores its passwords internaly, optionally protected by a master password. Plasma has its own password manager called KWallet5.
KWallet5 stores every password in the Plasma system, and protects access by a master password. With this extension you are able to use KWallet5 instead of the default Firefox password manager. It allows tighter integration of Firefox inside Plasma.
This extension is compatible with KDE5.X and Firefox > 33.
